# kete-tatu
a  game similar to tik-tak-toe with addition of ability to move the position of game element 
known in swahili as kete.
this game is familier to students around Tanzania, it has the similarities with tiktak toe but adds the ability to move tokens or kete like in chess or chekers.
I did not invent this game ,rather I want to digitize a part of my childhood that was interesting.

How to play

1. Players will play in turns to try to create a straight line with three tokens.

2. There is a valid move togle that can show you where you can play.

3.If all tokens are placed and there is no winner try moving your tokens to create a straight line
